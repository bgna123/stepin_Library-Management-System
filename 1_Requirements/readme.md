 Non Functional Requirements
## Functional Requirements:
Maintaining stock : 
  This is a very important feature of all library software. 
With the help of library system we can maintain the stocks such as books,newspapers, magazines more efficiently.
With the help of this feature our manual works have reduced to a great extent.
